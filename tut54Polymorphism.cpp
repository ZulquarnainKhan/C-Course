//-------------------- POLYMORPHISM IN C++ ------------------------------
// -> One name and multiple forms
// -> eg. Function overloading, Operator overloading, Virtual functions

/*
Polymorphism are of two types
    1. Compile time polymorphism:
        Here function is already binded to the compiler
    It is acheived using:
        ->Function overloading
        ->Operator overloading

    2. Run time polymorphism
        Late binding takes place here, after running
    It is acheived using:
        ->Virtual functions-
